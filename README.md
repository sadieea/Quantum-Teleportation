# Quantum-Teleportation-Simulation

This repository contains a simulation of the Quantum Teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of a quantum state from one qubit to another, using entanglement and classical communication. Quantum teleportation is a fundamental protocol in quantum mechanics, demonstrating the principles of entanglement, measurement, and superposition.

Project Overview
In this project, we simulate the three-step Quantum Teleportation protocol:

Entanglement Creation: An entangled pair of qubits is shared between two parties, traditionally called Alice and Bob.
Measurement & Communication: Alice performs measurements on her qubits and sends the results to Bob over a classical channel.
State Reconstruction: Bob applies the necessary operations to reconstruct the original quantum state.
This project is implemented using Qiskit, allowing for visualizations of each step.

Features
Entanglement: Creates and verifies entanglement between two qubits.
Teleportation Process: Simulates the teleportation of an arbitrary quantum state.
Measurement and Recovery: Demonstrates the measurement and state recovery steps.
